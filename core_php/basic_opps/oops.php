/*
From PHP5, you can also write PHP code in an object-oriented style.

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that 
perform operations on the data, 
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects 
that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP provide securities 
OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
Example :

Class ===   Fruits / car
Object  ====  apple,banana,orange / volve audi ford

oops Features : 

Class 
Object
Encapsulation
Inheritance / Reusability    == extends 
Access Modifier / Visibility  public private protected  
Polymorphism / overloading / overriding


Class :
Define a Class

making group of data member(variable) and member function that called class
A class is defined by using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces ({}). All its properties and methods go inside the braces:
Define Objects

Classes are nothing without objects! We can create multiple objects from a class. E
ach object has all the properties and methods defined in the class, but they will have different property values.
Objects of a class are created using the new keyword.
