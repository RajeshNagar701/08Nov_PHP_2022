What is an Event ?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the 
user or the browser manipulates a page.

When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, 
that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, 
closing a window, resizing a window, etc.
